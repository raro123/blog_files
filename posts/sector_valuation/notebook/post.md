# A Data Analyst's Role: From Question to Insight, a Market Valuation Case Study

People often wonder, "What is the job of a data analyst?" While the term is somewhat self-explanatory, it’s not always crystal clear to those outside the data-driven world. The proliferation of complementary roles, such as Data Engineers and Data Scientists adds to the confusion. For brevity, consider a data analyst as a blended role—someone who is both a business domain expert and a data domain expert. In a data-driven world, businesses expect data analysts to understand their questions in the language they speak and provide answers in the same language.

A common misconception is to attribute the data analyst’s role to specific tools: "You work on Power BI, Python, Tableau, or Excel." While tools are important, they’re necessary but not sufficient. Ultimately, stakeholders care less about the tools and more about the quality of the insights delivered.

In this case study, I aim to demonstrate how data analysts transform business questions into data insights. Using a hypothetical example grounded in real-world data, I’ll showcase the key steps in the data analytics project lifecycle, from problem framing to communication. This iterative process often uncovers new questions as answers emerge. So, let us dive straight into our case study.

## The Business Question

Those familiar with stock markets know that markets have declined over the past quarter. At the end of 2024, our investment committee became curious about current market valuations and sent an email to my team:

*"How do sector valuations look now after the market correction? Can your team provide a quick overview for the meeting next week?"*

## The Analytical Process

### 1. Problem Framing

The question seems simple on the surface, but as a data analyst, translating it into an analytical framework is key. Several sub-questions arise:
- What constitutes "valuation"?
- What is the benchmark period to compare current valuations against?
- Which sectors should we include?

These questions don’t have black-and-white answers. The decisions depend on the business context, industry relevance, and data availability. For this analysis, we decided to use the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio as our valuation metric, historical data from the past 20 years as our benchmark, and NSE sectoral indices to define the sectors.

### 2. Assumptions, Data Collection, and Preparation

We gathered historical PE ratios for all major Nifty sector indices from reliable financial data sources. This phase involved ensuring data consistency across time periods and creating a structured dataset for analysis. Data preparation is a critical step, often involving cleaning, deduplication, and validation—all of which ensure accuracy.

### 3. Analysis and Presentation

To provide a quick overview for the committee, we focused on visual storytelling with data. Here are two key visuals that summarize the findings:

#### Chart 1: "Cons Dur & Realty sector valuations farthest from long term avg"

This chart shows how current PE ratios compare to their historical medians across sectors. The arrows represent deviations, making it easy to identify which sectors are trading significantly above or below their long-term averages.

**Key Insights from Chart 1:**
- **High Premium Sectors**: Consumer Durables (Current PE: 87, Median PE: 67) and Realty (Current PE: 54, Median PE: 38) show the largest deviations, indicating significant overvaluation.
- **Moderate Premium Sectors**: IT, FMCG, and Healthcare sectors maintain valuations moderately above their historical medians.
- **Value Opportunities**: Banking and Auto sectors are trading at discounts to their historical medians.

#### Chart 2: "Except in Auto & Banking, valuation still above long term average"

This chart provides a broader view, showing the minimum, median, current, and maximum PE ratios for each sector. Auto and Banking stand out as the only sectors trading below their long-term medians.

**Key Insights from Chart 2:**
- Most sectors are still trading above their historical medians, despite the recent market correction.
- The significant variance in PE ratios highlights opportunities for selective investment strategies.

### Investment Implications

The analysis reveals actionable insights for investment decisions:
- **Selective Positioning**: The high premiums in Consumer Durables and Realty suggest these sectors may warrant caution for new investments.
- **Opportunities in Undervalued Sectors**: The relatively lower valuations in the Banking and Auto sectors could present buying opportunities. Banking, in particular, deserves closer examination given its fundamental importance to the economy.
- **Sector-Specific Strategies**: Investors should consider sector fundamentals and market trends when making allocation decisions.

## Closing Thoughts
